      <p>At the heart of Fullcrum are your developers. How do they feel about their work environment? Their 
         studio heads? Their lead? We’ve created a web-based questionnaire that’s derived from years of 
         experience leading developers as well as proven research (think Gallup Q12). We’ve involved a 20-year 
         employee engagement consultant as well as more than a dozen industry veterans (CEO’s, HR leaders, 
         studio directors, and group managers from leading companies), all of whom say there’s nothing like this 
         anywhere.</p>

      <p>The admin interface for Fullcrum – also web-based – allows you to define custom groups for your 
         employees (e.g. Artists, Programmers, Project 1, Project 2), send them all survey links with a single 
         button, and quickly and easily analyze their anonymous responses in terms of nine categories of 
         engagement. Again, the industry vets who gave us development feedback said there’s never been a tool 
         like this. Here’s a point we’re particularly proud of: By aggregating the anonymous data of every studio 
         using the tool, we’ll be providing administrators with the ability to compare their studio’s results with 
         industry benchmarks, <em>something that’s never existed in the games industry</em>.</p>

      <p>We provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Group facilitation based on survey data to help create lasting improvements from the ground up.</li>
        <li>Follow up with studio leadership to help guide next steps.</li>
        <li>An outside perspective from a 16-year industry veteran…60+ companies worth of insight without any political ties or “office baggage”.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The data itself is no silver bullet. The best possible results will come from combining the data with 
         leadership buy-in and open discussions with empowered developers.</p>

      <p>Years of in-depth research across dozens of conventional industries show that very few employees are 
         truly engaged in their workplace. The difference between employees who are engaged vs. disengaged? <a href="http://fullsailstrategies.web12.hubspot.com/Portals/172297/docs/Employee-Engagement-and-Profits.pdf">[1]</a></p>
